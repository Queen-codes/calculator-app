## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development

-The goal is to continue building more projects and to get comfortable building more with Javascript. 
-I would also love to use Javascript classes more so as to solidify my knowledge.   

### Useful resources

- [Javascript Classes](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_classes.asp) - This helped me understand Javascript classes syntax perfectly. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [this.keyword](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand the this. keyword. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

## Acknowledgments
